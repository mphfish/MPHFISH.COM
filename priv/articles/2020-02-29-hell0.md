I think that if software development can be summarized in one (non-profane) word, it might be hubris. Perhaps it's because a [couple hundred years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#First_computing_device) we tricked some textile equipment into thinking. This made us clearly the superior being, and we haven't looked back since.

I wrote this blog software, standing as I always do on the shoulders of amazing giants. The tiny little rock that is chugging away, encased in a slightly warm aluminum shell, steadfastly obeying me through many lifetimes of human effort.

### For what?

Well, ultimately I guess for you to read this, and therefore provide me some sort of edification.

I do digress though.

### yeah, cool, ok.

Ah yes, you're asking about [muh genius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weUDuqA6dF4)? Good good, let's talk a bit about what is bringing these pixels to your screen.

[This application](https://github.com/mphfish/mphfish.com) is written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), built using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), deployed using [Docker](https://docker.com) onto a [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) server.

Yeah, it's extremely overwrought. But hey, I always say that if your personal blog that you do not marketing for, and probably will stop writing at any time cannot handle making it to the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), what are you doing here?

### Does anyone think you're funny?

Sometimes!

So, when this application first starts, it reads in all of the articles (including this one!). Each article contains a couple of parts:

```markdown
{
"is_draft": false
}
===
where have all the cowboys gone?
```

The front matter is just a simple JSON object, which turns into the title, slug, and all that fun stuff. The body is processed, and turned into HTML content.

Once compiled, the articles are stored [in ETS](https://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html) with the article slug being the key. Subsequent requests serve them from this cache!

### Hey, that's kind of neat, but what else can you talk about?

I'm going to do [my very best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuYeHPFR3f0) to post here at least once a week, whenever I find something particularly interesting or if I have anything to say.

It's very likely to just be Elixir/React related, but maybe when I'm feeling fiesty we'll do some iOS apps or something!

Anyways, feel free to check back, or don't!
